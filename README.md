# LSTM Next-Word Text Generator

A Python project that uses **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** networks to predict the next word(s) given a seed text. The project includes a **Gradio web interface** for easy interaction.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Train an **LSTM model** for next-word prediction.
- Tokenizes input text and generates **n-gram sequences** for training.
- **Predicts the next word(s)** from a given seed text.
- **Gradio web app** to interactively generate text in your browser.
- Save and load trained **model** and **tokenizer** for reuse.
